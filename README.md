# Heaps and Beaps

A comprehensive implementation and performance comparison of Binary Heaps and Bi-parental Heaps (Beaps) data structures with **educational visualizations**.

## Project Overview

This project provides implementations of two heap data structures:
- **Binary Heap**: A complete binary tree implemented as an array
- **Beap (Bi-parental Heap)**: A 2D array-like structure with diagonal parent-child relationships

Both data structures are evaluated and compared across various operations. The project includes **step-by-step educational animations** for teaching and presentations.

## Features

### Data Structures
- Complete implementation of Binary Heap
- Complete implementation of Beap (Bi-parental Heap)

### Operations
Both data structures support:
- **Min/Max**: Find minimum/maximum values
- **Search**: Find a specific value
- **Insert**: Add a new value
- **Extract**: Remove a specific value

### ðŸŽ¬ Educational Visualizations
- Step-by-step animated GIFs showing BEAP operations
- Color-coded nodes for clear visual progression
- Perfect for academic presentations and teaching

## Performance Summary

| Operation | Binary Heap | Beap |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Min       | O(1)        | O(1) |
| Max       | O(n)        | O(n) |
| Search    | O(n)        | O(sqrt(n)) |
| Insert    | O(log n)    | O(log n) |
| Extract   | O(log n)    | O(log n) |
